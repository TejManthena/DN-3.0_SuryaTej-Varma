# Understanding

Recursion is a programming method where a function solves a problem by calling itself with a modified input. It relies on two key elements:

1. Base Case: A condition that terminates the recursive calls, providing a direct solution for the simplest scenario.
2. Recursive Case: The part where the function calls itself with altered parameters, gradually working towards the base case.

Recursion is effective for tasks that can be divided into similar smaller tasks, such as computing factorials, traversing data structures, or executing algorithms like mergesort. Proper recursion ensures that each call moves closer to the base case to prevent infinite loops.

# Benefits of Recursion

1. **Elegant Solutions**: Problems like tree traversal and combinatorial algorithms are naturally suited to recursive approaches, resulting in cleaner and more intuitive code.
2. Reduced Code Duplication: Recursion often reduces the need for repetitive code, leading to more concise implementations of algorithms.

## Disadvantages of Recursion

1. Performance Overhead: Recursive calls add overhead due to additional function calls and stack operations, which can be less efficient than iterative solutions.
2. Stack Overflow Risk: Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth is too high, particularly in languages with limited stack size.
