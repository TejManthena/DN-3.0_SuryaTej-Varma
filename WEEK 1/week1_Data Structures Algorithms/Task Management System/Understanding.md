### Singly Linked List

A Singly Linked List consists of nodes where each node contains data and a link to the next node. It allows forward traversal only.

- Insertion: O(1) at the head, O(n) elsewhere.
- Deletion: O(1) at the head, O(n) elsewhere.
- Search: O(n).

Advantages: Simple and dynamic.
Disadvantages: Only supports forward traversal.

# Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List has nodes with data and links to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.

- Insertion: O(1) at the head/tail, O(n) elsewhere.
- Deletion: O(1) at the head/tail, O(n) elsewhere.
- Search: O(n).

Advantages : Supports bidirectional traversal.
disadvantages: Uses more memory per node and is more complex.
